## What is SwitchResX Mac?

SwitchResX Mac is a utility designed for users who need deeper control over **[display resolution](#)** and external monitor behavior on macOS. It helps manage screen modes beyond the default options, which is useful when working with unusual displays, projectors, or multi-monitor setups.

The app enables **[monitor control](#)** features such as custom resolutions, refresh rates, and mode switching—tools that can solve scaling issues, blurry output, or missing options when connecting different hardware.

SwitchResX Mac is particularly helpful in professional environments where consistent output matters: editing, color-critical work, presentation setups, and workstation docking. Better **[screen management](#)** reduces interruptions and keeps your workspace predictable.

By extending macOS display configuration with advanced controls, SwitchResX Mac gives power users the flexibility to tune their setup for comfort, clarity, and compatibility.
